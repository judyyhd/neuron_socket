# Smart Plug Analysis for Hotel Devices
[TOC]

## Statement of Purpose
This repository contains the data and analysis scripts for an exploratory study of two smart plugs deployed in a hotel setting. The first smart plug powers an **automated delivery robot**, which transports parcels from staff to hotel guests. The second powers a **public PC** located in the hotel‚Äôs lobby.

The project‚Äôs aim is to uncover operational patterns and energy usage trends, which can provide insights into the behavior and utilization of each device. By comparing these patterns, we explore how energy consumption reflects different usage contexts (robotic automation vs. human-operated terminal) and identify opportunities for smart facility optimization.

## About the Data
The socket data is provided by Bi-Fan Yin of ‰ΩèÂèãÈÖíÂ∫ó and was requested by Alex Hon.

Each dataset includes four columns:

- **equipmentName**: 
  - `Zprime_Socket_01` ‚Äî delivery robot plug  
  - `Zprime_Socket_02` ‚Äî public PC plug
- **functionType**: 12 types, including current, power, voltage, relay status, temperature, and more (detailed below).
- **time**: ISO 8601 timestamp with UTC offset.
- **value**: The measured reading for the specific functionType.

## Analysis Highlights

### üì¶ Delivery Bot Smart Plug

- **Preprocessing**: Timestamps parsed, time series resampled to consistent intervals.
- **Feature Exploration**: Correlation matrix, value distributions, and trend visualizations.
- **Clustering**: PCA + K-Means clustering + manual boundary tuning.
- **State Modeling**: Custom state labels (e.g., idle, charging, active), transition matrices, stationary distributions.
- **Temporal Profiling**: Usage breakdowns by hour, weekday, and time-of-day segments.

### üñ•Ô∏è Public PC Smart Plug

- Similar approach applied to uncover usage routines.
- Clustering more effective due to less binary structure.
- Power states captured weekday vs. weekend activity.
- PCA revealed key drivers like ambient temperature and voltage influence.

### üìä Comparison
- The delivery bot‚Äôs usage is **highly polarized**, dominated by predictable charging cycles.
- The public PC has **more variable and human-driven usage**, enabling richer unsupervised clustering.
- Analysis framework scales across devices and reveals potential **automation thresholds** and **scheduling opportunities**.
